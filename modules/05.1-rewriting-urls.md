# Rewriting URLs

### With Apache's .htaccess

Suppose we have the following requests that we want to handle:

``
https://www.jollibeedelivery.com.ph/products
https://www.jollibeedelivery.com.ph/cart
``

First, let's try `rewriting` /products to be handled by `index.php`.

In our `.htaccess` file, we'll write something like:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^products index.php [L]
```

### (Future Reference for you) With NGINX
