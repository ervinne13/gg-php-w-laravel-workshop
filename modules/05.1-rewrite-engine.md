# Redirecting to index.php

### With Apache's .htaccess

Suppose we have the following requests that we want to handle:

``
https://www.jollibeedelivery.com.ph/products
https://www.jollibeedelivery.com.ph/cart
``

First, let's try `rewriting` /products to be handled by `index.php`.

In our `.htaccess` file, we'll write something like:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^products index.php [L]
```

This means that when the route `/products` is accessed, redirect the request to `index.php`.

To redirect with all routes:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [L]
```

The `RewriteRule` accepts 3 parameters:
1. A regex expression where urls will be matched against
2. The php file where Apache will redirect the route into
3. Is the flag for the rewrite.
    - In this case, we used `[L]`. `[L]` is a flag that means that if this rule matches, then no other rule matching will be performed for this page.
    - You can add multiple flags inside the `[ ]`.
    - Another common flag is `QSA` which means that if there's a query string passed with the original URL, it will be appended to the rewrite (`products?p=1` will be rewritten as `index.php?url=products&p=1`). This is useful if we want to know what url was accessed.

For more information aboute rewrite rule flags, see [this documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/flags.html).


#### Preventing Redirects to index.php Rewrite Conditions (RewriteCond)

With the current setup, even routes to our assets will be redirected to `index.php`. Since we don't want that, we specify:

```
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -f
```

Which tells us to not process this RewriteRule if the resource being accessed is a file `-f`.

But what if our assets is inside a folder? For this, we'll have to rewrite condtions for folders (directory) as well

```
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -f
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -d
```

There are also chances that our folders/directories are in symbolic links. For this cases we add `-l`:

```
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -f
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -d
RewriteCond %(REQUEST_FILENAME) -l
```
