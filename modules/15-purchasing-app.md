# Creating our Simple Purchasing Project

Requirements:
- Create a simple form that describes a simple purchasing form.
- In the future, we want a full table for our purchasing details, for now, we can put the items to be purchased in a text area.
- The form will have the following functions:
    - Save, Update, Delete, View
    - Send for Approval
    - Approve 1
    - Approve 2
    - Post
- The functions Send for Approval onwards will be done after a do it yourself session.
