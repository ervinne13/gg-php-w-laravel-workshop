# Laravel Features (Part 1)

## Creating a Project

Let's first create a new project:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel purchasing
```

You may also install a helper for creating new laravel projects by:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Then the previous command can then be changed to:

```bash
laravel new purchasing
```

## Overview

The instructor will walk you through the Laravel documentation first, afterwards, we'll walk through everything again but the next time, by creating a purchasing module for our project.
